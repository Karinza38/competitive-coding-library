g++ -Wl,--stack,16777216 -o file.exe file.cpp
Sets stack size to 16777216 bytes

On Linux, to get an unlimited stack, you should open a shell and run this command:
$ ulimit -s unlimited
And then (until you close that shell) the stack limit for that shell (and for the commands you will call from inside that shell, like ./program < input.txt and so on) will be unlimited.
